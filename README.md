# Email-spam-or-ham-project-
Spam email is unsolicited and unwanted junk email sent out in bulk to an indiscriminate recipient list. Typically, spam is sent for commercial purposes. It can be sent in massive volume by botnets, networks of infected computers.While some people view it as unethical, many businesses still use spam. The cost per email is incredibly low, and businesses can send out mass quantities consistently. Spam email can also be a malicious attempt to gain access to your computer.
 About the Project
This is a project I am working on while learning concepts of data science and machine learning. The goal here is to identify whether an email is spam or ham. We will take a dataset of labeled email messages and apply classification techniques. We can later test the model for accuracy and performance on unclassified email messages. Similar techniques can be applied to other NLP applications like sentiment analysis etc.
Whether an email message is spam or a legitimate advertisement, in the United States it's subject to the guidelines in the CAN-SPAM act.

When businesses capture your email address, they often subscribe you to their newsletter by default, as a low-cost way to sell their products. Whenever you fill out an online form, look for a checkbox to opt into or out of marketing email. While these emails can be pesky, most are harmless, and by law they must have a visible opt-out or unsubscribe option.

If you unsubscribe and continue to receive spam, update your email settings to filter messages from the sender's address out of your inbox.
Ironically, antivirus warnings are a common spam tactic. These emails warn you about a computer virus infection and offer a solution--often an antivirus scan--to fix the alleged cyber threat. But taking the bait and clicking the link can grant the hacker access to your system or may download a malicious file.

If you suspect that your computer is infected, do not click a random email link. Instead, pursue legitimate cybersecurity software solutions to protect your endpoints.

Why are phishing email scams often effective? Because the spam emails masterfully mimic legitimate corporate messages to get you to act. In a spoofing attack a spammer picks a company brand victims will trust, such as a bank or an employer, then uses the company's exact formatting and logos.

Before you reply or click anything, check the From line to make sure that the sender's email address (not just the alias) is legitimate. When in doubt, contact the company to verify whether the email is real.
