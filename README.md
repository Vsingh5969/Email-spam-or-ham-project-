# Email-spam-or-ham-project-
Spam email is unsolicited and unwanted junk email sent out in bulk to an indiscriminate recipient list. Typically, spam is sent for commercial purposes. It can be sent in massive volume by botnets, networks of infected computers.While some people view it as unethical, many businesses still use spam. The cost per email is incredibly low, and businesses can send out mass quantities consistently. Spam email can also be a malicious attempt to gain access to your computer.
 About the Project
This is a project I am working on while learning concepts of data science and machine learning. The goal here is to identify whether an email is spam or ham. We will take a dataset of labeled email messages and apply classification techniques. We can later test the model for accuracy and performance on unclassified email messages. Similar techniques can be applied to other NLP applications like sentiment analysis etc.
